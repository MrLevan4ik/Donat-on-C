# Donat-on-C
The classic donat write on C promming language
------------------------------------------------------------
After installing the code, open cmd in Explorer and go to the directory with the code, then if you have Linux or WSL, then write the command:
```
gcc main.c
```
if this command does not work, then enter:
```
g++ main.c
```
On Windows everything is similar, write later on Linux
```
./a.out
```
being in the same directory, and on Windows run it through Explorer
